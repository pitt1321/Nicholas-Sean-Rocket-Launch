# Nicholas-Sean-Rocket-Launch
Final Project
Computational Methods Final Project Proposal

	We plan on simulating a rocket launch, using a tank of fuel as a means of propulsion.  This would mean that as we use fuel to increase our upward force and acceleration, we would lose mass.  The opposing forces to this will be two different forces that change with distance above the surface.  The first is gravity, whose force will get weaker as the rocket distances itself from the center of the earth.  The second is the force opposing the direction of movement, drag, which is dependent on the air pressure that the rocket is within at that moment.  This also decreases as the rocket distances itself from earth, leaving the atmosphere.
	We plan to launch at the equator, similar to how most rockets are launched, due to the rotation of the earth providing the necessary tangential velocity to bring the rocket (or whatever is being sent up) into orbit around the earth.  Once we have the variables necessary for this to be achieved, we can try launching it at different points on the earth to see how spectacularly we can make it fail.  If we are able to make a stable orbit around the earth, we can try and see what we would need to change in the variables to put the rocket into a geo-synchronous orbit.
	Test Cases would be to set up the launch of the rocket one variable at a time. (ie decrease of force of gravity, drag, and the loss of mass.)
