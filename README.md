Final Project
Computational Methods Final Project Proposal

Minimum Goal:
We plan on simulating a rocket launch, using a tank of fuel as a means of propulsion.  This would mean that as we use fuel to
increase our upward force and acceleration, we would lose mass.  The opposing forces to this will be two different forces that change with distance above the surface.  The first is gravity, whose force will get weaker as the rocket distances itself from the center of the earth.  The second is the force opposing the direction of movement, drag, which is dependent on the rocket's velocity and the air pressure that the rocket is within at that moment (air pressure decreases as the rocket distances itself from earth, leaving the atmosphere).

Next level goals:
We plan to launch at the equator, similar to how most rockets are launched, due to the rotation of the earth providing the necessary tangential velocity to bring the rocket (or whatever is being sent up) into orbit around the earth.  Once we have the variables necessary for this to be achieved, we can try launching it at different points on the earth to see how spectacularly we can make it fail. For instance, we can try launching it at one of the poles. In this case, the earth's rotation would not provide any tangential velocity to the rocket, so launching it straight up could never get it into orbit.

Stretch goal:
If we are able to make a stable orbit around the earth, we can try and see what we would need to change in the variables to put the rocket into a geo-synchronous orbit.
	
Test cases would concern the differential equaitons we use derived from Newton's laws to model the rocket's trajectory.

1. Consider only reduced downward force due to mass loss (i.e. ignore drag, etc).
2. Consider only drag force
3. Consider only weakening gravitational force
